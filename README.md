## Blocitoff: an application that allows users to create self-destructing to-do lists

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

We built the Frontend using AngularJS and Backend implemented using Rails as an API.


### General Overview

Build an application that allows users to create self-destructing to-do lists.


### User Stories:

**View Active Tasks**

    As a user, I want to see my active tasks in a list as my default view

**Hide Old Tasks**

    As a user, I want completed tasks and tasks older than seven days hidden from my main task views automatically

**View Past Tasks**

    As a user, I want expired and completed tasks presented in a separate view

**Create New Tasks**

    As a user, I want to submit new tasks with a description, priority level, and three states: expired, completed or active

**Mark Tasks Complete**

    As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete

**User Sign Up**

**User Sign in and Out**

**User Profile**

**Create To-Do Items**
